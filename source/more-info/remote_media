In order to use the media browser with Home Assistant, it needs to know where to
find your remote media, e.g. a directory on your Network Attached Storage (NAS).

## Home Assistant Core

If you run Home Assistant Core directly in, for example, a Python virtual
environment, you'll need to create a media folder yourself, update your file table
and create a specific user on the remote system.

By default, Home Assistant will look for the `media` folder inside your current
Home Assistant configuration folder. As your media is sotred on your NAS
the media folder shall direct to your NAS. In order to get there follow the
steps below.

First you need to create a user on the remote system, e.g. your NAS storage.
Create a user strong password in your NAS web administration console.
On my Synology NAS I created the user `homeassistant` with an automatically
created password first. On the first login on the NAS web interface with
the `homeassistant` user I changed the password to the final and strong one.

Now move to your Home Assistant system and create a smb. file with the
log-in credentials user you created on your NAS for remote access.

For example, if your Home Assistant system user is `homeassistant`:

`sudo nano /home/homeassistant/.smb`

Add the following with the user credentials you created on your NAS:

`username=<Username>`
`password=<Password>`
`domain=<Domain>`     <-- Optional

Then create a folder on your Home Assistant system, e.g.

`/media/music`

Now we need to create a mount in the `/etc/fstab` to the remote NAS storage:

`sudo nano /etc/fstab`

Add the following line at the end of the fstab and replace the blanks:

`//<NAS IP-Address>/music   /media/music    cifs    uid=0,credentials=/home/homessistant/.smb,iocharset=utf8,noperm        0       0`

You close to completion. Mount the new entry in fstab with the following command:

`sudo mount -a`

When you now refresh your Home Assistant web page or switch to `Media` you
should see your music. :)
